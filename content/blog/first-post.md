Hello there!

I've started this site to try and gather information and reviews about products suitable for vegans in the hobby industry.  You might be surprised to hear that even some paints contain animal product!

Some things you may not have considered:

 
- Which paints are okay for vegans
- Epoxy Putties 
- "Natural" Hair brushes (They mean Fur brushes. It's the Fur Trade.A Sable is a very adorable animal)
- Polymer Clays
- Glues
- Primers
- Varnishes 

also throw in some stuff like Synthetic Brush reviews, Paint and Airbrush reviews.

What I won't be doing is really talking about veganism in general or trying to convince you to be vegan or arguing with people who try to send me 'helpful' info about how vegans end up killing more animals (lol, no), or how we have fangs so are carnivores (go look at a gorilla's mouth. Ideally closely.), or just any of of that kind of junk. 

If you want to reduce your animal cruelty in your life and you do Warhammer, Age of Sigmar, Conquest, Necromunda, Carnivale, Kings of War or any of the other miniature hobbies then this could be useful site for you.
