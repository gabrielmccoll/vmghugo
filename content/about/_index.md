Hello there!

I've started this site to try and gather information and reviews about products suitable for vegans in the hobby industry.  You might be surprised to hear that even some paints contain animal product!

Some things you may not have considered:

 
- Which paints are okay for vegans
- Epoxy Putties 
- "Natural" Hair brushes (They mean Fur brushes. It's the Fur Trade.)
- Polymer Clays
- Glues
- Primers
- Varnishes 

also throw in some stuff like Synthetic Brush reviews, FAQs.
